TESTING

Write tests for:
	- after_destroy on ForumPost to make sure we don't have any topics without posts.
	- after fixing validations on volunteer_offering, write test
	- duplicate email entry testing
	- write test for making sure email is entered in unit
	

VALIDATIONS

Create validations for:
	- volunteer_offerings; started on this, but didn't work so need to fix it. Need to make sure that if there is already a volunteer offering for a given individual that we don't create another.
	- create a duplicate email entry validation
